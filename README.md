# ✨ Mall Customers Data Cleaning & Visualization Project

### 👩‍💻 Internship Task Submission by: **Roshani Chorghe**

---

## 🎯 **Objective**
The main goal of this project is to perform **data cleaning, transformation, and visualization** on the *Mall Customers Dataset* using Python (Pandas and Matplotlib).  
This task aims to demonstrate how raw data can be cleaned, standardized, and analyzed to extract meaningful business insights.

## 🧹 **Data Cleaning & Preparation Tasks Performed**

1. **Loaded the Dataset** using Pandas and displayed the first few records.  
2. **Checked for Missing and Duplicate Values** to ensure data accuracy.  
3. **Standardized Text Values** – converted all gender entries to lowercase for consistency.  
4. **Renamed Column Headers** to clean, uniform names (e.g., `CustomerID → Customer_ID`, `Spending Score (1-100) → Spending_Score`).  
5. **Added a New Column – `Visit_Date`** to simulate customer visit records.  
6. **Converted Date Format** into a consistent style (`dd-mm-yyyy`).  
7. **Sorted Data by Age** to observe spending trends across different age groups.  
8. **Grouped Data by Gender & Age** to analyze average spending behavior.  
9. **Created Age Groups (16–25, 26–35, etc.)** for better segmentation and analysis.  
10. **Visualized the Data** using a **Bar Chart** to represent the *average spending score by age group*.

## 📊 **Insights Gained**
- Younger customers (especially those aged 26–35) tend to have higher spending scores.  
- Gender-based analysis showed distinct spending behavior patterns.  
- Cleaned and structured data helped identify key customer segments.

## 💡 **Conclusion**
This project helped transform unorganized data into clean, analyzable form — making it easier to visualize and interpret customer behavior patterns.  
It reflects practical skills in **data cleaning, transformation, and visualization**, which are key parts of real-world data analysis.
